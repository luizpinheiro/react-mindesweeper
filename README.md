# React Minesweeper (Mine Field, Campo Minado)

This is a recreation of the classic Minesweeper (or MineField) game. It was developed using only 
React, Typescript and Styled Components on a tedious saturday afternoon (I also had a cold that day).

All of the icons came from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) (credits within the web page).

## Oh, so you want to play it? 

Of course you can. [Check it out](https://url-come-here.com).

#### Enjoy, copy, delete, destroy, break it, or do whatever you want with it!
